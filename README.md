## SongNFT Contract

The `SongNFT` contract is the core component of the zkSync Streaming Platform that enables musicians and artists to mint their music tracks as unique NFTs on the blockchain. Each NFT represents a song with associated metadata including:

- Title and symbol of the music collection
- Audio URI pointing to IPFS-stored song files
- Cover art URI
- Artist wallet address

### Key Features

- **Minting:** Users can mint an NFT for a specific song, making it a collectible unique token.
- **Streaming Tracking:** The contract tracks how many times each song is streamed and maintains user-specific stream history.
- **Royalties:** The contract accumulates royalty payments for artists based on streams and enables payout functions.
- **Access Control:** Only NFT owners can retrieve the audio URI for their song, protecting artist content.
- **Integration:** Designed to work alongside other zkSync Streaming Platform contracts for playlist management (`zkTune`) and payment abstraction (`Paymaster`).

This contract is deployed on the Lisk Sepolia Testnet and demonstrates a decentralized approach to music rights management and streaming monetization.
